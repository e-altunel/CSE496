# Project Schema

<img src="../diagrams/out/use_scenario/UserScenario.png"/>

- We are designing an **API** that will allow multiple hardware devices to be accessed from a single point.
- User can mount our filesystem to their system and can access all the files by using simple commands like `ls`,`cd` or `rm`.

# Requirements for the project

<style>
	ul li {
		font-size: 22px;
	}
</style>

- I should develop a **Disk Management System** that will allow to write/read a chunk to destination independent of the type of the disk. I am planning to support Disks, Media Devices(USB), Partition of Disks and Binary Files in another filesystem.
- I should develop a **File Folder Abstraction** that will allow to create, delete, ... operations on files and folders.
- I should develop a **Encryption System** that will allow to encrypt a chunk of data before writing to the disk and decrypt it after reading from the disk.
- I should add a **File Placement Optimization** that will allow to place the files in the disk according to the file type/size and disk type. For example, small files should be placed in faster drives, and large files should be placed in slower and larger drives.
- I should develop a **Combine Helper** that will help to combine multiple disks to a single disk. I am planning to add a simple GUI for this operation.
- I should write functions for kernel calls.

---

# Project Requirements - 2

- To develop a **Disk Management System**, i could use low-level disk operations like `read` and `write` operations. I could use syscalls directly. So i should use low-level languages like `C` or `C++`.
- To answer kernel calls from user-level, i should use a library like `libfuse` or `Dokany`. Currently, i am focusing on linux, so i will use `libfuse`.
- To develop a simple GUI, i could use `Qt` or `GTK`. I will use `Qt` because it is more user-friendly and has more documentation.
- To develop a **File Folder Abstraction**, i am planning to use a simple tree structure.

---

# Success Criteria

- There must not be any data loss.
- The system should be able to handle multiple disks.
- The system is not responsible for the data loss if the user removes the disk while writing to the disk. But could detect the error and inform the user.
- The system should work asynchronically. There could be multiple read/write operations at the same time.
- The bloat of the system should be minimal. The system should be able to run on a low-end system.
- Encryption should be secure. Without the key, the data should not be readable or overwriteable.
- Files of the same folder could be placed in different disks. The system should be able to handle this situation.
- Chunks of same file could be placed in different disks. The system should be able to handle this situation.
- The system should be independent of the disk type. The system should be able to handle SSD, HDD, USB, and other disk types.
- The system use less memory and disk space as possible.
- If an operation cancels or fails, the system should be able to handle this situation.
- The system should work UNIX-like systems. And could answer any kernel calls.

# Combine Helper GUI Example

Here is an image of Windows Disk Management. I am planning to develop a similar GUI for combining multiple disks
